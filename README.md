# SPT Launcher Configurator
This is a small little standalone tool to edit and modify the existing configurations and settings for my [SPT Launcher](https://github.com/minihazel/SPTMiniLauncher).

## What does it do?
It allows you to safely edit the existing configurations (Gallery, Settings and Third Party Apps files) in a controlled environment without interruption. It's merely more than a fancy string editor.

## But why?
Honestly? I'm too lazy to overhaul the way that my [SPT Launcher](https://github.com/minihazel/SPTMiniLauncher) reads and writes to its settings.

I implemented this quick little app to make changes to them in a separate environment.
